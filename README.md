# Powershell_Projects
Miscellaneous Powershell scripts that I've written.

# Currently:
1. Credentials Leaker - a simple powershell phishing script that allows attackers to leak user's credentials based on their input. Checks if the credentials are valid, and if so it will be leaked. If not, the user will need to type it again.



2. Bitlocker drive encryptor.

3. Fake WannaCry screen.
